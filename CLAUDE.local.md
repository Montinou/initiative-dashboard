## Development Quality Assurance Guidelines
- Whenever coordinating Devs - QA agents, follow these principles:
  1. Batch QA Reviews - Let agents complete 2-3 tasks, then deep QA analysis
  2. Code-First Validation - Always verify actual implementation exists
  3. Technical Debt Scanning - Automated tools to detect violations
  4. Quality Gates - Block progress until real quality standards met
