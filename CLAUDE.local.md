## Database Guidelines
- Always make sure you are following @public/schema-public.sql for everything related to database, in auth schema we only have users

## Development Quality Assurance Guidelines
- Whenever coordinating Devs - QA agents, follow these principles:
  1. Batch QA Reviews - Let agents complete 2-3 tasks, then deep QA analysis
  2. Code-First Validation - Always verify actual implementation exists
  3. Technical Debt Scanning - Automated tools to detect violations
  4. Quality Gates - Block progress until real quality standards met

## Documentation Guidelines
- keep everything as is actually documented in @docs/API_REFERENCE.md, @docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md. If something needs changing from that core structure you have to specifically tell me to confirm.
