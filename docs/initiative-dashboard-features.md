# Initiative Dashboard - Implemented Features

## Overview

The Initiative Dashboard is a comprehensive system for tracking and managing strategic initiatives with subtasks and company area assignments. Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, and follows the project's glassmorphism design system.

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

#### `company_areas`
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `name` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- `description` (TEXT, Optional)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)

#### `initiatives`
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `title` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- `description` (TEXT, Optional)
- `progress` (INTEGER, 0-100, DEFAULT 0)
- `area_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to company_areas)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)

#### `subtasks`
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `title` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- `description` (TEXT, Optional)
- `completed` (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT FALSE)
- `initiative_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to initiatives, CASCADE DELETE)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)

### Database Features
- **Automatic Progress Calculation**: Initiative progress is automatically calculated based on completed subtasks
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All tables have RLS enabled with authenticated user policies
- **Indexes**: Performance indexes on foreign keys and commonly queried fields
- **Triggers**: Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates and progress recalculation
