## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to any analytics page
2. Use the filter sidebar to select:
   - Date range (optional)
   - Areas (optional)
   - Status (on status distribution page)
3. Charts and data automatically update
4. Click "Export Data" to download CSV
5. Click "Reset" to clear all filters

### For Developers
```typescript
// Use filter context in components
import { useAnalyticsFilters } from '@/contexts/AnalyticsFilterContext'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { selectedAreas, startDate, endDate, getFilterParams } = useAnalyticsFilters()
  
  // Get filter parameters for API calls
  const params = getFilterParams()
  
  // Use with SWR or fetch
  const apiUrl = `/api/endpoint?${new URLSearchParams(params)}`
}

// Export data
import { exportToCSV, prepareAnalyticsExport } from '@/utils/exportData'

const handleExport = () => {
  const preparedData = prepareAnalyticsExport(data, 'area-comparison')
  exportToCSV(preparedData, 'area-comparison')
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Date range filter works on all pages
- [x] Area filter works on all pages
- [x] Export functionality works on all pages
- [x] Charts update when filters change
- [x] Reset button clears all filters
- [x] API endpoints respect filter parameters
- [x] Responsive layout on all screen sizes

## Next Steps

1. Add more filter types:
   - Priority filter for objectives
   - Manager filter for areas
   - Quarter filter as alternative to date range

2. Add filter persistence:
   - Save filter preferences to localStorage
   - Restore filters on page reload

3. Add advanced export options:
   - Excel format export
   - PDF report generation
   - Scheduled exports

4. Performance optimizations:
   - Add debouncing to filter changes
   - Implement data caching
   - Add loading states for filter updates
