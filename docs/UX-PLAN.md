## UX Requirements & User Flows

### Primary User Flow: Accessing Stratix Assistant
1. **Entry Point**: User clicks "Stratix Assistant" in main navigation
2. **Initial State**: Dashboard view with overview of available analyses
3. **Analysis Request**: User triggers analysis or views cached results
4. **Loading State**: Clear loading indicators during backend processing
5. **Results Display**: Structured presentation of KPIs, diagnostics, and action plans
6. **Interaction**: User can drill down into specific recommendations

### Secondary User Flows
- **Refresh Analysis**: Manual trigger for updated insights
- **Export Results**: Download or share analysis results
- **Historical View**: Access to previous analyses and trends
- **Deep Dive**: Navigate to specific areas or initiatives from recommendations

### 4. Insights Panel (`InsightsPanel`)
**Purpose**: Present AI-generated insights and diagnostics
**Structure**:
- Categorized insights (Performance, Risk, Opportunities)
- Priority indicators (High, Medium, Low)
- Interactive elements for more details
- Visual icons for insight categories

### 5. Action Plans Section (`ActionPlansSection`)
**Purpose**: Display recommended actions with priorities
**Features**:
- Categorized recommendations
- Timeline indicators
- Effort/impact matrix visualization
- Link to related initiatives or areas

### 6. Data Connection Status (`DataConnectionStatus`)
**Purpose**: Show authentication and data sync status
**Indicators**:
- Connection health
- Last sync timestamp
- Data freshness warnings
- Reconnection controls if needed

## Interaction Patterns

### Loading States
- **Skeleton Loading**: Use skeleton screens for predictable content areas
- **Progress Indicators**: Show percentage completion for analysis processes
- **Estimated Time**: Display expected completion time for longer operations
- **Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel long-running analyses

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Show cached data when real-time analysis fails
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific, actionable error descriptions
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Easy ways to retry failed operations
- **Fallback Content**: Alternative content when primary data unavailable

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile First**: Optimize for mobile interaction patterns
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add desktop-specific features
- **Touch Targets**: Ensure appropriate sizing for mobile taps
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe for navigation where appropriate

## Visual Design Specifications

### Layout Grid
- **Desktop**: 12-column grid with 24px gutters
- **Tablet**: 8-column grid with 20px gutters  
- **Mobile**: 4-column grid with 16px gutters

### Typography Hierarchy
- **H1**: 32px/40px - Main section title
- **H2**: 24px/32px - Subsection headers
- **H3**: 20px/28px - Card titles
- **Body**: 16px/24px - General content
- **Caption**: 14px/20px - Metadata and labels

### Color System (Building on existing themes)
- **Primary**: Use theme-specific primary colors
- **Success**: #10b981 - Positive KPIs and completed actions
- **Warning**: #f59e0b - Attention-needed items
- **Error**: #ef4444 - Critical issues or failures
- **Info**: #06b6d4 - Neutral information and tips

### Spacing Scale
- **4px**: Tight spacing within components
- **8px**: Standard component padding
- **16px**: Card padding and small gaps
- **24px**: Section spacing and large gaps
- **32px**: Major layout separations

## Accessibility Considerations

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab Order**: Logical tab sequence through interactive elements
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus states
- **Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (refresh, export)
- **Skip Links**: Allow users to skip to main content

### Screen Reader Support
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmarks
- **ARIA Labels**: Descriptive labels for complex interactions
- **Live Regions**: Announce status changes and updates
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptions for data visualizations

### Visual Accessibility
- **Contrast Ratios**: Meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Color Independence**: Don't rely solely on color for meaning
- **Text Scaling**: Support up to 200% zoom without horizontal scrolling
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion preferences

## Integration Points
