#### QA Engineer Findings:

**Critical Issues Found:**

1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**
   - ❌ **CRITICAL**: Service role key used everywhere, bypassing RLS completely
   - ❌ No file type validation beyond content-type header (easily spoofed)
   - ❌ No virus scanning on uploaded files
   - ❌ Missing rate limiting on import endpoints
   - ❌ No validation of file size limits in processor (only in signed URL)
   - ⚠️ Potential SQL injection via unsanitized `ilike` queries with user data

2. **Error Handling Issues:**
   - ❌ Generic error messages expose internal details (stack traces)
   - ❌ No retry mechanism for transient failures (GCS, DB connections)
   - ❌ Missing error boundaries for async processing
   - ❌ No cleanup of partial imports on failure
   - ⚠️ Silent failures in email lookup (assigned_to returns null without warning)

3. **Data Integrity Problems:**
   - ❌ No transaction wrapping for multi-entity operations
   - ❌ Race conditions possible with concurrent imports
   - ❌ Case-insensitive matching could overwrite wrong records
   - ❌ No duplicate detection within same file
   - ⚠️ Orphaned job items if job update fails

4. **Performance Bottlenecks:**
   - ❌ Row-by-row processing even in "batch" mode (N+1 queries)
   - ❌ No connection pooling management
   - ❌ Buffer entire file in memory (OOM risk for large files)
   - ❌ No streaming parser for large CSV/Excel files
   - ⚠️ Inefficient case-insensitive queries without proper indexes

5. **Type Safety Issues:**
   - ❌ Extensive use of `any` types throughout processor
   - ❌ Missing type guards for runtime validation
   - ❌ Unsafe type assertions without checks
   - ⚠️ JSON parsing without schema validation

6. **Missing Edge Case Handling:**
   - ❌ Empty files cause uncaught errors
   - ❌ Malformed CSV with mismatched columns crashes
   - ❌ Excel files with multiple sheets not handled correctly
   - ❌ Special characters in filenames break GCS paths
   - ❌ Circular references in objective-initiative links
   - ❌ Date validation allows invalid dates (Feb 31)

7. **API Design Issues:**
   - ❌ Inconsistent error response formats
   - ❌ Missing API versioning
   - ❌ No request ID for tracing
   - ⚠️ Pagination without stable ordering

8. **Testing Gaps:**
   - ❌ No unit tests for processor functions
   - ❌ No integration tests for file upload flow
   - ❌ No load testing for concurrent imports
