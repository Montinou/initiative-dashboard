# KPI Standardization System - Agent Coordination Plan

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Project Status**: 82% complete (18/29 tasks)
**Critical Gap**: Testing coverage at 15% (target: 90%)
**Production Blocker**: Security vulnerabilities and insufficient test coverage
**Immediate Action Required**: Coordinate 4 specialized agents for completion

- Excel import validation comprehensive
- End-to-end workflows tested

**Context Files**:
- `/components/forms/KPIDashboard/` directory
- Performance issues section from QA report
- `/components/excel-import/ExcelImportWizard.tsx`

**Agent Instructions**:
Focus on completing the partially implemented features identified in the QA report. Dashboard components are 75% complete - finish real-time updates and role-based visibility. Then implement performance optimizations.

---

## PHASE 4: UX POLISH & ACCESSIBILITY (Days 4-6)

### Agent Assignment: ux-enhancer

**PRIMARY MISSION**: Complete accessibility compliance and UX polish

**Critical Tasks**:
- Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (UX-001)
- Complete mobile optimization (MOBILE-001)
- Break down large component files for maintainability
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Add accessibility features and keyboard navigation

**Deliverables**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- Mobile-optimized interfaces
- Component refactoring completed
- Accessibility testing implemented

**Quality Gates**:
- Accessibility audit passed
- Mobile responsiveness verified
- Component maintainability improved
- User experience polished

**Context Files**:
- Accessibility compliance section from QA report
- Large component files: `ExcelImportWizard.tsx`, `InitiativeForm/index.tsx`

**Agent Instructions**:
Focus on accessibility compliance and mobile optimization. The QA report identified that WCAG compliance hasn't been verified and mobile experience needs optimization. Also refactor large components for maintainability.

## CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES

### Blocking Dependencies
1. **TEST-001 blocks production deployment** - Must complete before any release
2. **Security fixes block production** - Cannot deploy with known vulnerabilities
3. **Weight calculation bugs block data accuracy** - Must fix before user adoption

### Sequential Dependencies
1. Security fixes should complete before final testing
2. Dashboard completion enables full integration testing
3. Performance optimization should complete before load testing

### Parallel Opportunities
1. Testing and security work can proceed in parallel
2. Dashboard completion and performance work can overlap
3. UX polish can proceed independently once core features are stable

---

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### High-Risk Mitigations
1. **Testing Implementation Risk**
   - Daily progress check-ins with test-automation-engineer
   - Focus on critical business logic first
   - Implement smoke tests early for immediate feedback

2. **Security Implementation Risk**
   - Prioritize HIGH security issues first
   - Implement security fixes incrementally
   - Validate each fix immediately after implementation

3. **Integration Complexity Risk**
   - Maintain component-level isolation during development
   - Regular integration testing throughout development
   - Clear interface contracts between components

### Quality Gates
- **Gate 1 (Day 2)**: Core unit tests implemented, critical security fixes deployed
- **Gate 2 (Day 4)**: Integration tests complete, all security vulnerabilities resolved
- **Gate 3 (Day 6)**: Production readiness validation, all acceptance criteria met
