- Dashboard components and pages
- Other utility files and components

## ⚠️ INITIATIVE-DASHBOARD FOLDER FINDINGS

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**: The `/initiative-dashboard/` folder contains files that do NOT meet current analysis.md standards:

### ❌ initiative-dashboard/app/api/areas/route.ts - NOT COMPLIANT
- ❌ Missing tenant filtering in database queries
- ❌ Uses `getUserProfile(request)` but lacks proper tenant isolation
- **SECURITY CONCERN**: Database queries without consistent tenant filtering

### ❌ initiative-dashboard/hooks/useAreas.tsx - NOT COMPLIANT
- ❌ Missing tenant filtering: no `eq('tenant_id', profile.tenant_id)`
- ❌ No authentication validation before operations
- ❌ Real-time subscriptions without tenant filtering
- **MAJOR SECURITY ISSUE**: Cross-tenant data leakage possible

### ❌ initiative-dashboard/lib/auth-context.tsx - NOT COMPLIANT
- ❌ Overly complex authentication logic with timeout issues
- ❌ Missing consistent tenant context patterns
- ❌ No proper error handling standards
- ❌ Complex manager context without proper security isolation

**CONCLUSION**: The `/initiative-dashboard/` folder appears to contain LEGACY implementations that do NOT meet current security standards. Main folder implementations should be used as the authoritative reference.
