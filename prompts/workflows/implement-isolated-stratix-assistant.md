<task name="Implement Isolated Stratix Assistant">

<task_objective>
Create a standalone, isolated implementation of the Stratix Assistant that can be tested independently from the main Mariana application. Input includes existing stratix-assistant configuration files (agent-config.json, instructions.md, stratix-bot-config.md), Supabase Edge Function (stratix-handler), and documentation files. Output will be a complete standalone application with its own dependencies, configuration, test environment, and isolated database setup that mirrors the functionality of the integrated assistant.
