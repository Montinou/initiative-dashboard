# Dashboard Modularization Requirements

## Current State
- Single monolithic dashboard component (1155 lines)
- 5 API endpoints providing different dashboard data views
- Existing navigation system with routes not yet implemented
- Glassmorphism design system with purple to cyan gradients

## Requirements
1. Transform monolithic dashboard into modular route-based architecture
2. Create frontend pages for each API endpoint:
   - /dashboard/area-comparison - Area performance comparison view
   - /dashboard/objectives - Objectives tracking view
   - /dashboard/progress-distribution - Progress distribution analytics
   - /dashboard/status-distribution - Status distribution overview
   - /dashboard/trend-analytics - Trend analysis and forecasting

3. Design a cohesive navigation system that:
   - Integrates with existing DashboardNavigation component
   - Provides sub-navigation within dashboard section
   - Maintains visual hierarchy and user orientation
   - Supports mobile and desktop experiences

4. Each module should:
   - Have its own dedicated page/route
   - Fetch data from corresponding API endpoint
   - Display data using appropriate visualizations
   - Maintain consistent glassmorphism styling
   - Be fully responsive

5. User Experience Goals:
   - Clear information architecture
   - Smooth transitions between views
   - Progressive data loading
   - Contextual filtering capabilities
   - Unified design language

## Design Constraints
- Must use existing UI components (Radix UI)
- Follow glassmorphism design patterns
- Use Recharts for data visualization
- Maintain accessibility standards
- Support theme customization (FEMA blue, SIGA green themes)

## Deliverables Needed
1. Information architecture and navigation flow
2. Wireframes/mockups for each dashboard module
3. Component specifications and interactions
4. Data visualization strategies for each view
5. Mobile responsive patterns
6. Loading and error states design
7. Filter and search interface designs

## Implementation Guide
See [UX-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md](./UX-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md) for detailed specifications, design patterns, and development guidelines.

## Enhanced UX Requirements

### Navigation Architecture
- **Primary Routes**: Overview, Initiatives, Areas, Analytics (with sub-routes), Objectives, Reports
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Maintain user orientation across nested routes
- **Mobile-First**: Bottom tab navigation for mobile, collapsible sidebar for desktop

### Performance Requirements
- **Perceived Load Time**: < 200ms for navigation
- **Progressive Loading**: Critical content first, enhancements second
- **Smart Prefetching**: Anticipate user navigation patterns
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for all actions

### Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile interactions
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators with glassmorphic styling
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user preferences for animations

### Interaction Patterns
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth glassmorphic animations (400ms cubic-bezier)
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens matching final layout
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with clear recovery paths
- **Empty States**: Actionable guidance when no data available

### Data Visualization Strategy
- **Trends**: Interactive line/area charts with zoom capabilities
- **Distributions**: Pie/donut charts with drill-down functionality
- **Comparisons**: Bar/radar charts with multi-select options
- **Progress**: Animated progress bars and gauge charts

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Stack on mobile, grid on desktop
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe navigation, pull-to-refresh
- **One-Handed Mode**: Critical actions within thumb reach
- **Offline Capability**: Cache critical data for offline access
