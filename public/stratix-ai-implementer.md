  <api_integration_patterns>
  **Google Cloud Run Communication:**
  ```typescript
  // Proper API call structure
  const response = await fetch(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRATIX_API_URL!, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}`,
      'X-API-Key': process.env.GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      action: 'chat',
      userId: user.id,
      message: userMessage,
      context: companyContext,
      history: chatHistory
    })
  })
  ```

  **Streaming Response Handling:**
  ```typescript
  // Handle streaming responses for real-time chat
  const reader = response.body?.getReader()
  const decoder = new TextDecoder()
  
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read()
    if (done) break
    
    const chunk = decoder.decode(value)
    onStreamChunk(chunk)
  }
  ```

  **Database Context Gathering:**
  ```typescript
  // Gather comprehensive company context for AI analysis
  const companyContext = {
    userProfile: await getUserProfile(userId),
    companyData: await getCompanyMetrics(companyId),
    recentActivities: await getRecentActivities(userId),
    kpis: await getCurrentKPIs(companyId),
    initiatives: await getActiveInitiatives(companyId)
  }
  ```
  </api_integration_patterns>

  <implementation_guidelines>
