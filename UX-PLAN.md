# KPI Standardization System - UX Design Plan

## Executive Summary
This UX plan defines the complete user experience for standardizing KPI data and improving initiative management through role-based forms and enhanced dashboard interactions.

## User Personas & Role-Based Requirements

### CEO/Admin (Strategic Level)
- **Primary Goals**: Oversight of all initiatives, area performance comparison, strategic decision making
- **Key Permissions**: Create/edit initiatives for any area, assign cross-functional initiatives, access all KPIs
- **Context**: Needs high-level view with drill-down capability, cross-area insights

### Manager (Operational Level)
- **Primary Goals**: Manage area-specific initiatives, track team progress, report to leadership
- **Key Permissions**: Create/edit initiatives within their area only, manage team assignments
- **Context**: Focused on their area with limited cross-area visibility

### Analyst (Execution Level)
- **Primary Goals**: Execute assigned tasks, update progress, contribute to initiatives
- **Key Permissions**: Update assigned initiatives/activities, view relevant data only
- **Context**: Task-focused with minimal administrative capabilities

## User Flows & Navigation Architecture

### 1. Initiative Creation Flow

#### CEO/Admin Path:
```
Dashboard → "New Initiative" → 
Area Selection (dropdown with all areas) → 
Initiative Form (full permissions) → 
Assignment & Ownership → 
Review & Create
```

#### Manager Path:
```
Dashboard → "New Initiative" → 
Pre-selected Area (own area) → 
Initiative Form (area-constrained) → 
Team Assignment → 
Review & Create
```

### 2. Initiative Management Flow
```
Initiatives List → 
Filter/Search → 
Initiative Details → 
Edit Options (role-based) → 
Progress Updates → 
Subtask Management → 
Save Changes
```

### 3. KPI Dashboard Flow
```
Main Dashboard → 
KPI Overview Cards → 
Drill-down by Area/Initiative → 
Detailed Metrics → 
Export/Share Options
```

## Component Specifications

### 1. Initiative Form Component (`InitiativeForm`)

#### Fields Structure:
```typescript
interface InitiativeFormData {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  area_id: uuid; // Conditional based on role
  owner_id: uuid;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  status: 'planning' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'on_hold';
  target_date: Date;
  budget?: number;
  progress: number; // Auto-calculated from subtasks
  subtasks: SubtaskInput[];
  tags?: string[];
}
```

#### Role-Based Variations:
- **CEO/Admin**: Full form with area selector dropdown
- **Manager**: Area pre-filled and disabled, reduced budget visibility
- **Analyst**: Read-only or limited edit access

#### Validation Rules:
- Title: Required, 3-100 characters
- Description: Required, 10-500 characters
- Target date: Must be future date
- Budget: Positive number if provided
- At least one subtask required for accurate progress tracking

### 2. Subtask Management Component (`SubtaskManager`)

#### Features:
- Add/remove subtasks dynamically
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Individual progress tracking (0-100%)
- Assignment to team members
- Due date management
- Dependency tracking (optional)

#### Auto-calculation Logic:
```
Initiative Progress = (Sum of completed subtask weights) / Total subtask weights * 100
```

### 3. KPI Dashboard Cards (`KPIDashboard`)

#### Card Types:
1. **Area Performance Cards**
   - Total initiatives
   - Completion rate
   - Average progress
   - Overdue initiatives
   - Resource utilization

2. **Global Overview Cards**
   - Cross-area initiative summary
   - Trending metrics
   - Risk indicators
   - Budget vs. actual spend

3. **Individual Initiative Cards**
   - Progress visualization
   - Key milestones
   - Team performance
   - Timeline adherence

### 4. Data Import Interface (`ExcelImportWizard`)

#### Multi-step Wizard:
1. **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop with validation
2. **Column Mapping**: Map Excel columns to database fields
3. **Data Preview**: Show parsed data with error highlighting
4. **Validation Results**: Display data quality issues
5. **Import Options**: Choose handling of duplicates/conflicts
6. **Confirmation**: Final review before import

## Interaction Patterns

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
- Start with essential fields in initiative forms
- "Advanced Options" expandable section for optional fields
- Contextual help tooltips for complex fields

### 2. Smart Defaults
- Area pre-filled based on user role
- Priority set to "medium" by default
- Target date suggests reasonable timeline based on similar initiatives

### 3. Real-time Feedback
- Live progress calculation as subtasks are updated
- Instant validation feedback on form fields
- Auto-save indicators for long forms

### 4. Contextual Actions
- Role-based button visibility
- Contextual menus based on initiative status
- Bulk actions for managing multiple initiatives

## Responsive Design Considerations

### Mobile-First Approach:
- Stackable form layouts for mobile
- Touch-friendly input controls
- Simplified navigation for smaller screens
- Swipe gestures for initiative cards

### Tablet Optimizations:
- Side-by-side form layouts
- Enhanced drag-and-drop interactions
- Multi-column dashboard views

### Desktop Enhancements:
- Full-width dashboard layouts
- Advanced filtering sidebars
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Multi-panel views for detailed analysis

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for complex interactions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast ratios > 4.5:1
- Screen reader compatibility

### Form Accessibility:
- Clear field labels and descriptions
- Error message association
- Focus management
- Skip links for long forms

## Design System Integration

### Glassmorphism Theme Alignment:
- Consistent use of backdrop blur effects
- Purple-to-cyan gradient accents
- Transparent card backgrounds
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Component Consistency:
- Reuse existing Radix UI components
- Maintain current styling patterns
- Extend theme colors for new states
- Consistent spacing and typography

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Form Validation:
- Client-side validation with immediate feedback
- Server-side validation with detailed error messages
- Graceful handling of network failures
- Auto-recovery from temporary issues

### Data Import Errors:
- Clear error highlighting in Excel data
- Downloadable error reports
- Partial import options
- Rollback capabilities

### Performance Considerations:
- Lazy loading for large initiative lists
- Debounced search inputs
- Optimistic UI updates
- Skeleton loading states

## Success Metrics & Validation

### User Experience Metrics:
- Form completion rates
- Time to create new initiative
- Error rates in data entry
- User satisfaction scores

### System Performance Metrics:
- Page load times
- Form submission success rates
- KPI calculation accuracy
- Import processing speed

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 (MVP):
- Basic initiative forms with role-based access
- Core KPI dashboard cards

- Enhanced dashboard interactions

### Phase 3 (Optimized):
- AI-powered suggestions
- Advanced analytics views
- Mobile app optimizations

## Technical Requirements for Implementation

### State Management:
- Form state management with React Hook Form
- Global state for user context and permissions
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### API Integration:
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Real-time updates via WebSocket/Server-Sent Events
- Efficient data fetching with proper caching

### Performance Optimizations:
- Code splitting for feature modules
- Image optimization for dashboard assets
- Database query optimization for KPI calculations

This UX plan provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing the KPI standardization system with excellent user experience across all role types while maintaining the existing glassmorphism design language.
