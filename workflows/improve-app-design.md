<task name="Improve App Design">

<task_objective>
Transform the InsAIght application's visual design to achieve an elegant, minimalist, enterprise-level aesthetic with 2025 design trends. This workflow will implement sober elegant coloring, sophisticated animations, and modern UI patterns while maintaining all existing functionality. The output will be updated CSS files, component styling, and enhanced visual hierarchy that creates a professional, warm, and approachable user experience using the existing blue primary color palette with strategic neutral tones.

# Improve App Design Process - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Update Global Design System and Color Palette

1. **Analyze Current Color Palette**
   - Use the `read_file` command to examine current color variables in `/app/globals.css`
   - Identify primary blue (#3b82f6) and existing color schemes
   - Map current design tokens to new 2025 trends

2. **Implement 2025 Minimalist Color System**
   - Replace harsh contrasts with warm neutrals (creamy whites, soft grays)
   - Introduce Mocha Mousse (#7D6A5A) as secondary warm accent following 2025 trends
   - Maintain blue primary (#3b82f6) but add muted variations
   - Create nature-inspired supporting colors (sage greens, warm creams)

3. **Update CSS Variables and Design Tokens**
   - Use the `edit_file` command to update root CSS variables
   - Implement new neutral base colors with strategic blue accents
   - Add gradient definitions for subtle depth
   - Create new shadow systems with softer, more natural shadows

## 2. Modernize Component Library with Evolved Minimalism

1. **Transform Card Components**
   - Update `.insight-card` styling with subtle glass morphism
   - Implement soft, natural shadows instead of harsh borders
   - Add warm background tints with improved contrast
   - Create sophisticated hover states with gentle transitions

2. **Enhance Form Elements**
   - Redesign input fields with rounded corners and soft shadows
   - Add focused states with subtle glow effects
   - Implement floating label animations for modern feel
   - Update button styling with refined typography and spacing

3. **Refine Navigation Components**
   - Update `.insight-nav-item` with softer active states
   - Add subtle background treatments for better hierarchy
   - Implement smooth transition animations between states
   - Create badge-style indicators with rounded aesthetics

## 3. Implement Sophisticated Animation System

1. **Add Purposeful Micro-Interactions**
   - Create smooth hover animations for interactive elements
   - Implement gentle scale and lift effects on cards
   - Add subtle fade-in animations for content loading
   - Design form field focus animations with soft glows

2. **Enhance Page Transitions**
   - Update existing stagger animations with natural easing
   - Add slide-up animations with improved timing
   - Implement content reveal animations for sections
   - Create loading state animations with elegant spinners

3. **Add Lightning Dark Mode Enhancements** (Optional)
   - Improve dark mode color transitions
   - Add subtle glow effects for interactive elements
   - Implement smooth theme switching animations
   - Create depth with layered shadows in dark mode

## 4. Refine Visual Hierarchy and Typography

1. **Update Typography System**
   - Enhance heading styles with refined letter spacing
   - Improve line height ratios for better readability
   - Add text shadow effects for depth where appropriate
   - Create consistent sizing scale with better proportions

2. **Implement Improved Spacing System**
   - Add more generous white space for breathing room
   - Create consistent padding and margin scales
   - Improve component spacing relationships
   - Implement better content flow and grouping

3. **Enhance Content Presentation**
   - Update data visualization colors for better accessibility
   - Improve table and list styling with softer borders
   - Add subtle background patterns for visual interest
   - Create better information hierarchy with color and typography

## 5. Add Advanced Visual Effects

1. **Implement Natural Motion Patterns**
   - Update existing animations with curved motion paths
   - Add spring-based easing functions for organic feel
   - Create particle effects for special interactions (optional)
   - Implement gesture-friendly animations for mobile

2. **Add Depth and Layering**
   - Create proper z-index layering system
   - Add backdrop blur effects where appropriate
   - Implement subtle gradient overlays for depth
   - Create floating action button styles

3. **Optimize for Accessibility**
   - Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG contrast ratios
   - Add reduced motion options for accessibility
   - Implement focus indicators that work with new design
   - Test color blindness compatibility

## 6. Testing and Refinement

1. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Use browser developer tools to test across different browsers
   - Verify animations work smoothly across devices
   - Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Ensure backwards compatibility

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize CSS file size while maintaining functionality
   - Optimize animation performance with GPU acceleration
   - Ensure smooth 60fps animations
   - Test loading performance with new styles

3. **Visual Consistency Review**
   - Review all pages for consistent styling application
   - Ensure design system is applied uniformly
   - Check for any remaining legacy styling conflicts
   - Validate that all interactive elements have proper states

## 7. Documentation and Implementation

1. **Update Style Documentation**
   - Document new color palette and usage guidelines
   - Create component style guide for future reference
   - Update design system documentation
   - Provide migration notes for any breaking changes

2. **Final Implementation**
   - Use the `edit_file` command to apply all changes to `/app/globals.css`
   - Test functionality to ensure no breaking changes
   - Verify all form submissions and interactions still work
   - Confirm responsive design maintains functionality

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Perform comprehensive visual review of all pages
   - Test all user workflows to ensure functionality is preserved
   - Verify animations don't interfere with user interactions
   - Confirm accessibility standards are maintained
