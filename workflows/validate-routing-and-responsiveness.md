<task name="Validate Routing and Responsiveness">

<task_objective>
Comprehensively validate and improve the Next.js application's routing system and responsive design. This workflow ensures proper user role access controls, validates URL routing correctness, and implements responsive design for mobile and various screen resolutions. Inputs include the existing Next.js app with authentication middleware, routes, and components. Processing involves systematic testing and fixing of routing logic, access controls, and responsive layouts. Output will be a fully validated routing system with comprehensive responsive design improvements and a detailed validation report.

# Validate Routing and Responsiveness - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Audit Current Routing Structure

1. **Map All Application Routes**
   - Use `find` and `glob` tools to locate all page files in the app directory
   - Document route hierarchy: `/`, `/auth/login`, `/demo`, `/profile`, `/superadmin/*`, etc.
   - Identify dynamic routes with parameters (e.g., `/superadmin/tenants/[id]`)
   - Map API routes and their corresponding handlers

2. **Analyze Middleware Configuration**
   - Read and examine `middleware.ts` file
   - Document protected routes and their access rules
   - Identify role-based routing logic
   - Check middleware matcher patterns and route exclusions

3. **Review Layout Components**
   - Examine root `app/layout.tsx` and nested layouts (e.g., `app/superadmin/layout.tsx`)
   - Document layout hierarchy and inheritance
   - Identify theme providers and global components

4. **Document Authentication Flow**
   - Map user authentication states and corresponding routes
   - Identify redirect logic for unauthenticated users
   - Document role-based access patterns

## 2. Validate User Role Access

1. **Identify User Roles and Permissions**
   - Read `lib/role-permissions.ts` and `lib/role-utils.ts`
   - Document all user roles (e.g., superadmin, admin, user, etc.)
   - Map role permissions to specific routes and actions

2. **Test Route Access by Role**
   - Superadmin routes: `/superadmin/*` - verify superadmin-only access
   - User profile routes: `/profile/*` - verify authenticated user access
   - Public routes: `/`, `/auth/login`, `/demo` - verify public access
   - Protected routes: identify and test authentication requirements

3. **Validate Middleware Protection**
   - Test unauthenticated access to protected routes
   - Verify proper redirects to login pages
   - Test role-based access restrictions
   - Validate session handling and token verification

4. **Check Authorization Logic**
   - Review auth context implementations in `lib/auth-context.tsx`
   - Test permission checks in components and pages
   - Verify role-based UI element visibility
   - Test unauthorized access handling

## 3. Verify URL Routing Logic

1. **Test Static Route Resolution**
   - Verify all static routes resolve correctly
   - Test direct URL access via browser
   - Check for 404 handling on non-existent routes
   - Validate canonical URL structures

2. **Test Dynamic Route Parameters**
   - Test `/superadmin/tenants/[id]` with valid and invalid IDs
   - Verify parameter parsing and validation
   - Test edge cases (empty, special characters, very long IDs)
   - Check error handling for invalid parameters

3. **Validate API Route Endpoints**
   - Test all API routes: `/api/profile/*`, `/api/superadmin/*`, `/api/upload`, etc.
   - Verify HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) work correctly
   - Test API authentication and authorization
   - Validate request/response formats and error handling

4. **Test Navigation and Redirects**
   - Test programmatic navigation between routes
   - Verify redirect logic in middleware and components
   - Test browser back/forward navigation
   - Check for infinite redirect loops

## 4. Analyze Current Responsive Design

1. **Audit CSS Framework Implementation**
   - Review Tailwind CSS configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`
   - Examine responsive utilities usage in components
   - Check custom breakpoints and media queries
   - Review glassmorphism design system implementation

2. **Test Current Mobile Experience**
   - Use browser dev tools to test mobile viewports
   - Test common screen sizes: 320px, 375px, 414px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
   - Identify layout breaking points and overflow issues
   - Document current responsive behavior

3. **Review Component Responsiveness**
   - Examine dashboard components for mobile adaptation
   - Check UI components in `components/ui/*` for responsive design
   - Test navigation and sidebar behavior on mobile
   - Review form layouts and input field sizing

4. **Identify Responsive Design Gaps**
   - Document components that lack mobile optimization
   - Identify text sizing and readability issues
   - Find touch target size problems (buttons, links)
   - Note horizontal scrolling or overflow issues

## 5. Implement Responsive Improvements

1. **Enhance Mobile Navigation**
   - Implement collapsible navigation for mobile screens
   - Add hamburger menu or drawer navigation
   - Ensure touch-friendly navigation elements
   - Test navigation accessibility on mobile devices

2. **Optimize Dashboard Layout**
   - Make dashboard components stack vertically on mobile
   - Implement responsive grid layouts for data cards
   - Optimize chart and graph displays for small screens
   - Ensure proper spacing and touch targets

3. **Improve Form Responsiveness**
   - Optimize form layouts for mobile input
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation
   - Implement responsive form validation displays
   - Test input field sizing and accessibility

4. **Enhance Typography and Spacing**
   - Implement responsive typography scale
   - Adjust line heights and spacing for readability
   - Ensure adequate touch target sizes (44px minimum)
   - Optimize content hierarchy for mobile consumption

## 6. Test Cross-Device Compatibility

1. **Browser Testing**
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge browsers
   - Verify responsive behavior consistency
   - Test touch vs mouse interactions
   - Check browser-specific CSS compatibility

2. **Device Testing**
   - Test on actual mobile devices when possible
   - Use browser dev tools for comprehensive device simulation
   - Test portrait and landscape orientations
   - Verify touch gestures and interactions

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Test page load times on mobile networks
   - Verify image optimization and lazy loading
   - Check bundle size impact on mobile performance
   - Test scroll performance and animations

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Verify keyboard navigation on all screen sizes
   - Test screen reader compatibility
   - Check color contrast ratios
   - Ensure ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## 7. Document and Report Findings

1. **Create Routing Validation Report**
   - Document all tested routes and their status
   - List any routing issues found and their fixes
   - Provide role-based access validation results
   - Include security recommendations

2. **Create Responsive Design Report**
   - Document responsive improvements implemented
   - List browser and device compatibility results
   - Provide performance metrics and recommendations
   - Include accessibility compliance status

3. **Generate Implementation Summary**
   - Summarize all changes made to routing and middleware
   - Document responsive design improvements
   - List any remaining tasks or recommendations
   - Provide maintenance guidelines for future development

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with new routing information
   - Document responsive design patterns for the project
   - Add development guidelines for maintaining responsiveness
   - Include testing procedures for future changes
