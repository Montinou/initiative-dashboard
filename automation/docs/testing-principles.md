# Testing Principles and Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the core testing principles and guidelines for the Mariana project automation framework. These principles ensure consistent, reliable, and maintainable test code across all testing layers.

## Core Testing Principles

### 1. Test Pyramid Structure

Our testing strategy follows the test pyramid:

```
    /\
   /  \     E2E Tests (10-20%)
  /____\    Integration Tests (20-30%)
 /______\   Unit Tests (50-70%)
/________\
```

- **Unit Tests (50-70%)**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components, functions, and modules
- **Integration Tests (20-30%)**: Tests for component interactions, API endpoints, and data flow
- **E2E Tests (10-20%)**: Critical user journey tests across the entire application

### 2. Testing Standards

#### 2.1 Test Quality Requirements
- **Independence**: Each test must be independent and isolated
- **Repeatability**: Tests must produce consistent results across environments
- **Clarity**: Test names and structure must clearly communicate intent
- **Speed**: Unit tests under 100ms, integration tests under 5s, E2E tests under 60s
- **Reliability**: Flaky tests must be fixed immediately or removed

#### 2.2 Coverage Goals
- **Minimum**: 70% code coverage across all modules
- **Critical Paths**: 90%+ coverage for authentication, file processing, AI integration
- **Components**: 80%+ coverage for React components
- **Security**: 100% coverage for authentication and authorization logic

### 3. Test Organization

#### 3.1 Directory Structure
```
automation/
├── config/           # Test configurations
├── e2e/             # End-to-end tests
│   ├── auth/        # Authentication flows
│   ├── file-upload/ # File upload workflows
│   ├── stratix/     # AI assistant tests
│   └── multi-tenant/# Tenant isolation tests
├── integration/     # Integration tests
│   ├── api/         # API endpoint tests
│   ├── database/    # Database operations
│   └── services/    # Service integrations
├── unit/           # Unit tests
│   ├── components/ # React component tests
│   ├── hooks/      # Custom hook tests
│   └── utils/      # Utility function tests
├── fixtures/       # Test data and factories
├── utils/          # Test utilities and helpers
└── reports/        # Test reports and artifacts
```

#### 3.2 File Naming Conventions
- Unit tests: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `*.integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `*.e2e.ts`
- Page objects: `*.page.ts`
- Test utilities: `*.utils.ts`
- Fixtures: `*.fixture.ts`

### 4. Test Writing Guidelines

#### 4.1 Test Structure (AAA Pattern)
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should perform expected behavior when given condition', async () => {
    // Arrange - Set up test data and conditions
    const mockData = createMockData()
    const component = render(<Component {...props} />)
    
    // Act - Execute the behavior being tested
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'))
    
    // Assert - Verify the expected outcome
    expect(screen.getByText('Expected result')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

#### 4.2 Test Naming Convention
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Format: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- Examples:
  ```typescript
  it('should upload file successfully when valid Excel file is selected')
  it('should show validation error when file size exceeds limit')
  it('should restrict access when user lacks permissions')
  ```

#### 4.3 Assertion Guidelines
- Use specific assertions over generic ones
- Prefer semantic queries in React Testing Library
- Include meaningful error messages
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

### 5. Test Data Management

#### 5.1 Test Fixtures
- Use factories for dynamic test data generation
- Create reusable fixtures for common scenarios
- Maintain tenant-specific test data
- Keep test data minimal and focused

#### 5.2 Mock Strategy
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, services)
- Mock at the boundary of your system
- Avoid mocking implementation details
- Use real data structures in mocks

### 6. Multi-Tenant Testing

#### 6.1 Tenant Isolation
- Test data segregation between tenants
- Verify RLS policies in database tests
- Test subdomain routing and tenant resolution
- Validate cross-tenant access prevention

#### 6.2 Tenant-Specific Testing
- Create separate test suites for each major tenant
- Test tenant-specific configurations and themes
- Validate tenant-specific business rules
- Test data migration scenarios

### 7. Security Testing

#### 7.1 Authentication Tests
- Test login/logout flows for all user types
- Verify session management and expiration
- Test password reset and account recovery
- Validate multi-factor authentication flows

#### 7.2 Authorization Tests
- Test role-based access control (RBAC)
- Verify permission boundaries for each role
- Test privilege escalation prevention
- Validate API endpoint security

#### 7.3 Data Protection Tests
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Verify SQL injection prevention
- Test file upload security (type, size, content)
- Validate sensitive data handling

### 8. Performance Testing

#### 8.1 Load Testing
- Test file upload with large files
- Test concurrent user scenarios
- Test database performance under load
- Test AI processing with multiple requests

#### 8.2 Performance Benchmarks
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- File upload progress feedback < 1 second
- AI response time < 10 seconds
- Database queries < 500ms

### 9. Accessibility Testing

#### 9.1 A11y Standards
- Test keyboard navigation
- Verify screen reader compatibility
- Test color contrast and visual indicators
- Validate ARIA labels and roles

#### 9.2 Testing Tools
- Use automated accessibility testing in E2E tests
- Include manual accessibility checks
- Test with assistive technologies
- Validate responsive design across devices

### 10. CI/CD Integration

#### 10.1 Pipeline Requirements
- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage thresholds must be met
- Security scans must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained

#### 10.2 Test Execution Strategy
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on pull requests
- E2E tests run on staging deployments
- Full test suite runs on release branches

### 11. Error Handling and Debugging

#### 11.1 Test Debugging
- Use descriptive error messages
- Include relevant context in failures
- Generate screenshots for E2E test failures
- Capture network logs for API test failures

#### 11.2 Flaky Test Management
- Identify and fix flaky tests immediately
- Use retry mechanisms sparingly
- Add wait conditions instead of fixed delays
- Monitor test stability metrics

### 12. Documentation Requirements

#### 12.1 Test Documentation
- Document complex test scenarios
- Maintain README files for each test category
- Document setup and teardown procedures
- Keep test data documentation current

#### 12.2 Coverage Reporting
- Generate and review coverage reports
- Track coverage trends over time
- Identify uncovered critical paths
- Document coverage exceptions

## Implementation Checklist

### During Test Development
- [ ] Follow naming conventions and structure guidelines
- [ ] Implement proper setup and teardown
- [ ] Add both positive and negative test cases
- [ ] Ensure tests are independent and isolated
- [ ] Add appropriate assertions and error handling

### Test Health Monitoring
- Track test execution times and flakiness
- Monitor coverage trends and gaps
- Review and update testing strategies
- Ensure test environment stability
