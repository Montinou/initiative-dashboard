# Automation Agent Usage Instructions

## How to Use the Automation Agent

The automation agent is designed to be your dedicated Test Automation Engineer. It understands your project structure, technology stack, and testing requirements. Here's how to effectively use it:

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup
First, ask the agent to set up the automation framework:

```
"Initialize the automation framework with Playwright and Vitest"
```

This will:
- Install required dependencies
- Create the folder structure
- Set up configuration files
- Create sample tests
- Configure CI/CD integration

### 2. Environment Setup
Ask the agent to configure test environments:

```
"Set up test environments for development, staging, and production"
```

## Common Usage Patterns

### Creating New Tests

#### For New Features
```
"Create comprehensive tests for the new initiative sharing feature"
```

#### For Bug Fixes
```
"Add regression tests for the file upload timeout issue"
```

#### For Components
```
"Create unit tests for the new ProgressChart component"
```

### Maintaining Existing Tests

#### Updating Tests
```
"Update the authentication tests to handle the new OAuth flow"
```

#### Fixing Flaky Tests
```
"Fix the flaky dashboard loading test that's failing in CI"
```

#### Performance Optimization
```
"Optimize the E2E test suite to run faster in CI/CD"
```

## Specific Request Examples

## Agent Response Patterns

### When You Request Test Creation
The agent will:
1. Analyze the feature/component
2. Determine appropriate test types
3. Create test files with proper structure
4. Include comprehensive test cases
5. Add proper documentation
6. Ensure CI/CD compatibility

### When You Request Maintenance
The agent will:
1. Examine existing tests
2. Identify issues or improvements
3. Update configurations as needed
4. Optimize performance
5. Update documentation
6. Validate changes

### When You Request Analysis
The agent will:
1. Review current test suite
2. Identify gaps or issues
3. Provide recommendations
4. Create improvement plans
5. Suggest best practices
6. Document findings

## Example Conversation Flow

### User Request
```
"I need comprehensive testing for our new OKR progress tracking feature. It includes a progress bar component, API endpoints for updating progress, and real-time updates on the dashboard."
```

### Agent Response
The agent will create:
1. **Unit tests** for the progress bar component
2. **Integration tests** for the progress update API
3. **E2E tests** for the complete workflow
4. **Real-time update tests** using WebSocket mocking
5. **Performance tests** for bulk progress updates
6. **Error handling tests** for edge cases

## Troubleshooting Agent Requests

### If Tests Aren't Working
```
"Debug the failing E2E tests in the CI environment"
```

### If Performance is Poor
```
"Analyze and optimize test execution time"
```

### If Coverage is Low
```
"Identify test coverage gaps and create missing tests"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Patterns
```
"Create a custom testing pattern for our multi-step form workflows"
```

### Integration with External Tools
```
"Set up integration with our bug tracking system for test failures"
```

### Specialized Testing
```
"Create accessibility tests for our dashboard components"
"Add security testing for our API endpoints"
"Set up load testing for file upload functionality"
```

## Getting Help

### Agent Documentation
```
"Explain the current test framework setup"
"Show me the test coverage report"
"Document the testing best practices"
```

### Request Clarification
If the agent asks for clarification, provide:
- Specific requirements
- Expected behavior
- Error messages or symptoms
- Environment details
- Priority level

## Success Metrics

The agent tracks and optimizes for:
- **Test Reliability**: Consistent pass/fail results
- **Execution Speed**: Fast feedback loops
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 70% coverage
- **Maintainability**: Clean, readable test code
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless pipeline execution

Remember: The automation agent is your testing partner. The more specific and detailed your requests, the better it can help you build a robust, maintainable test suite.
