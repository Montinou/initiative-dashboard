## üìã Agent Orchestration Instructions for CLAUDE.md

### Adding to Your CLAUDE.md File

To enable intelligent agent orchestration during task execution, add the following instructions to your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Agent Orchestration System

### Automatic Agent Selection and Orchestration

When executing tasks, automatically orchestrate multiple specialized agents based on the task type and complexity. Use the Task tool with the following orchestration patterns:

### Task Analysis and Agent Assignment

For each user request, perform this analysis:
1. **Identify task type** (feature, bug fix, optimization, security, etc.)
2. **Determine complexity** (simple, moderate, complex)
3. **Select primary agent** (main implementer)
4. **Assign supporting agents** (reviewers, validators)
5. **Define orchestration sequence**

```

### Parallel vs Sequential Orchestration

#### Parallel Execution (when independent)
```
Launch simultaneously:
- Database Architect (schema design)
- UI/UX Designer (interface design)
- Documentation Agent (API docs)

Then converge:
- Developer Agent (implementation using all designs)
```

#### Sequential Execution (when dependent)
```
Step 1: Security Specialist (define requirements)
    ‚Üì
Step 2: Database Architect (secure schema)
    ‚Üì
Step 3: Developer Agent (implement)
    ‚Üì
Step 4: QA Engineer (validate)
    ‚Üì
Step 5: Testing Specialist (test coverage)
```

### Agent Communication Protocol

Agents must share:
1. **Context**: What they're working on
2. **Findings**: Issues discovered
3. **Decisions**: Architectural choices
4. **Handoffs**: What the next agent needs to know
5. **Blockers**: Issues preventing progress

Example handoff:
```
Database Architect ‚Üí Developer:
"Schema updated with new 'user_permissions' table.
Migration 001_add_permissions.sql created.
RLS policies defined for tenant isolation.
Use the getUserPermissions() helper for queries."
```

### Quality Gate Orchestration

Before marking task complete, orchestrate final validation:

```javascript
// Launch parallel quality checks
await Promise.all([
  launchAgent('QA Engineer', 'Final quality check'),
  launchAgent('Security Specialist', 'Security validation'),
  launchAgent('Performance Agent', 'Performance verification'),
  launchAgent('Testing Specialist', 'Test coverage check')
])

// Only proceed if all agents approve
if (allAgentsApprove) {
  markTaskComplete()
} else {
  orchestrateRemediationAgents()
}
```

### Monitoring and Adjustment

During execution:
1. Monitor agent progress
2. Detect when agents are blocked
3. Launch additional specialized agents as needed
4. Adjust orchestration based on findings

Example dynamic adjustment:
```
if (qaAgent.foundSecurityIssue) {
  launchAgent('Security Specialist', 'Address security concern')
}

if (performanceAgent.foundBottleneck) {
  launchAgent('Database Architect', 'Optimize queries')
}
```

### Agent Performance Metrics

Track for each orchestration:
- Task completion time
- Number of agents used
- Issues found/fixed
- Code quality scores
- Test coverage achieved
- Performance improvements

Use metrics to improve orchestration patterns over time.
```

### Concise CLAUDE.md Instructions

Add this to your CLAUDE.md for automatic agent orchestration:

```markdown
## Agent Orchestration for Task Execution

### Automatic Multi-Agent Workflow
When receiving tasks, orchestrate specialized agents using the Task tool based on complexity:

**Simple Tasks (< 30 min)**: Single agent execution
**Moderate Tasks (30 min - 2 hrs)**: Two-agent pattern (implement + review)
**Complex Tasks (> 2 hrs)**: Full multi-agent orchestration

### Standard Orchestration Sequences

**Feature Implementation:**
1. Database Architect (if DB changes) ‚Üí 2. Developer ‚Üí 3. QA Engineer ‚Üí 4. Security (if sensitive) ‚Üí 5. Testing

**Bug Fixes:**
1. QA Engineer (analyze) ‚Üí 2. Developer (fix) ‚Üí 3. Testing (regression)

**Performance:**
1. Performance Agent (profile) ‚Üí 2. Database Architect (optimize) ‚Üí 3. Developer (implement) ‚Üí 4. QA (validate)

**Security:**
1. Security Agent (scan) ‚Üí 2. Database (RLS audit) ‚Üí 3. Developer (fix) ‚Üí 4. Testing (validate)

### Agent Launch Protocol
```javascript
// Example: Feature requiring DB changes
await Task.launch({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Design database schema",
  prompt: `As Database Architect: Review /docs/schema-public.sql, design changes for [feature], ensure RLS/tenant isolation, create migrations. Report: changes, migration plan, performance impact.`
})

// After DB design, launch Developer
await Task.launch({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Implement feature",
  prompt: `As Developer: Using DB design from previous agent, implement [feature] following codebase patterns. Report: files created/modified, key decisions, test coverage.`
})

// Finally, QA validation
await Task.launch({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Review implementation",
  prompt: `As QA Engineer: Review implementation for bugs, security issues, edge cases. Test manually if possible. Report: issues found, suggestions, approval status.`
})
```

### Dynamic Orchestration Rules
- If QA finds security issues ‚Üí Launch Security Specialist
- If Performance degrades ‚Üí Launch Performance Agent
- If DB queries slow ‚Üí Launch Database Architect
- If UI/UX concerns ‚Üí Launch UI/UX Designer
- If documentation lacking ‚Üí Launch Documentation Agent

### Quality Gates Before Completion
Run parallel validation agents:
- QA Engineer: Code quality check
- Security: Vulnerability scan
- Performance: Speed verification
- Testing: Coverage validation

Only mark complete when all agents approve.

### Agent Communication
Each agent must provide structured handoff:
1. What was done
2. Key decisions made
3. Issues found
4. What next agent needs to know
5. Any blockers

Monitor agent progress and adjust orchestration dynamically based on findings.
```
